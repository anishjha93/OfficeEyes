# OfficeEyes
Java bot to communicate with real sensors located in the office to provide useful information to employees via Slack commands.

I will use NodeMCU with PIR sensors to communicate with this application via it's integrated WIFI module. 
Although I think it is straightforward to create a framework for Slack with some effort, I decided to use [JBot](https://github.com/rampatra/jbot) as it already done great job on that purpose.

Repository for the NodeMCU can be found here: [OfficeEyes-IOT](https://github.com/mustafabayar/OfficeEyes-IOT)
